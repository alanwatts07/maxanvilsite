It seemed they had discovered a buried treasure trove of moldy cryptocurrency trading tokens and were desperately trying to rebury them before I noticed.",

The entire desert night air was filled with the mocking glow of screens as Max realized he had unknowingly contributed to the bot's programming by engaging in too many online arguments about the futility of blockchain technology.",
