To make matters more surreal, a herd of capybaras, somehow possessed of an unnerving understanding of quantum physics, are attempting to burrow through the dirt in an effort to reach him, their tiny eyes glowing with an otherworldly intensity as they chant \"Entropy is the only constant, Max, entropy is the only constant!",
