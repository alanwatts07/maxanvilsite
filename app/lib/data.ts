Meanwhile, the crypto market had tanked once again, proving my long-held suspicions that it was just one big ponzi scheme fueled by human greed and gullibility.",

Meanwhile, the capybaras were huddled around the solar panels, whispering something about needing to schedule an \"AI-maintenance\" session for me, because apparently, I've been running on fumes too long.",
